A quiz game to test your knowledge of Japanese word readings.

KanjiLab is an open-source, portable desktop application designed to test and challenge your knowledge of Japanese word readings. Built with Rust and Svelte using the Tauri framework, it offers a fast and responsive experience for both solo play and peer-to-peer multiplayer sessions. All your data is stored locally in a SQLite database, ensuring complete privacy and offline functionality.

Please be aware that **KanjiLab is not designed to be a tool for learning Japanese**.

🚧 Beta Warning

Please note that KanjiLab is currently in the beta phase of development. While the core features are functional, you may still encounter bugs, performance issues, or unexpected behavior.

Important: Breaking changes may be introduced in future updates. This could potentially lead to the reset of your game statistics and user profiles.
